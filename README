IMPORTANT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is my first draft release! There are many things to rewrite, 
so this script will be changed soon.

Today the script supports only OpenCL v1.1 of Intel and NVIDIA 
vendors, and works with GCC.

This package provides a set of M4 macros to use with GNU Autoconf.
The purpose of these macros is to be able to easily find and test
presence of OpenCL libraries and headers.

This macro requires that you use GNU Libtool and assumes that you
already use GNU Automake.
